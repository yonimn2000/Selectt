A simple anonymous polling web application.

## Problem Statement

Polling anonymity is extremely important, meaning that a vote of an individual should not be tied to that individual. So, a fully functional web application that will allow anonymous voting and polling will be developed. Users will be able to register, create polls, and invite others to vote via an email link. The system will handle the integrity of one vote per person to ensure an accurate vote count, user privacy, and anonymity. Votes will be aggregated in the database so that individual votes will not be stored in the system.

## Objectives

* Allow registered users to create anonymous polls by inviting people to vote by email.
* Allow invited voters to vote without registering into the system.
* Store the votes in such a way that they cannot be tied to individual votes.
* Allow voters to see live vote count as soon as they vote.
